SAMPLE_TEXT = """# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs.

Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. The algorithm discovers structure without predefined labels.

Common algorithms include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis
- Autoencoders

## Applications

Machine learning is used in many fields:
1. Image recognition
2. Natural language processing
3. Recommendation systems
4. Fraud detection
5. Autonomous vehicles
